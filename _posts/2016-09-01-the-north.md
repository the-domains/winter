  spoke of elk herds that sickened and died after passing through the glacier’s
  shadow, slain by the earth-mother’s lingering birth pains.    Tiernon asked
  for the glacier’s name. They told him: the Gloomfrost.

# The North

Tiernon's boots crunched through the snow, his legs sinking to the hip with every step. Even bolstered by the magic of a _giant-kin belt_, the dwarf could barely struggle forward with the iron chest balanced on his shoulders.  
  
He spat curses as he forged through the snow. Curses kept him warm.  
  
The chest strapped to Tiernon's back was a crude, soot-black box. Secured by chains barely a finger's width thick, the chest was easily twice the dwarf's size. Frost-tinged shields, hammers, and axes dangled from its sides, rattling against the chest as Tiernon trudged steadily onward.  
  
Everything around him was white. The great ice plain of the North fell beneath his feet step by step, and the snowy air swirled around him. Even with the wind whipping his face, Tiernon's eyes remained fixed ahead, to where a thin black line cut across the vast whiteness.  
  
This black horizon was what called to Tiernon.  
  
The barbarians told him it was a great glacier, a sacred place that had suffered the pains of the world. They said it was where the earth had given birth to the sun, scorching the land for miles around as the newborn star had burst into the sky.
